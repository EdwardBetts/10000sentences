# 10,000 sentences

10,000 sentences is an Android app to help you learn new words in a foreign language.

## How it works

The idea is to go through 10,000 sentences. First you will se a sentence in a language you known and then you must guess the words of the same sentence in your target language. By exposing you to unknown words in a real context (a sentence) you will increase your vocabulary size.

At the moment the app has 8 languages, but more can be added easily. The sentences are ordered by complexity (more common words and shorter sentences first). The sentences collections are extracted from the [Tatoeba](https://tatoeba.org) collection (licensed under CC-BY 2.0).

Text-to-speech is available for some languages (depending on your Android phone and version).

All words can be shared/opened with Google Translate (or any other translate app) or AnkiDroid (or any other flashcard or spaced repetition app). If you use Google translate, enable "Tap to translate" and then just use the "To clipboard" option to show the Google Translate widget.

## TODO

* Skip sentences for advances users who feel the first sentences are too easy.
* Stats with graphs, goals, ...
