# 10,000 sentences

10,000 sentences is an Android app to help you learn new words in a foreign language.

## How it works

The idea is to go through 10,000 sentences in a language you learn. First you will se a sentence in a language you known and then you must guess the words of the same sentence in your target language. By exposing you to unknown words in a real context (a sentence) you will slowly (but steadily) increase your vocabulary size.

At the moment the app has 8 languages, but more can be added easily. The sentences are ordered by complexity (more common words and shorter sentences first). The sentences collections are extracted from the [Tatoeba](https://tatoeba.org) collection (licensed under CC-BY 2.0).

Text-to-speech is available for some languages (depending on your Android phone and version).

All words can be shared/opened with Google Translate (or any other translate app) or AnkiDroid (or any other flashcard or spaced repetition app). If you use Google translate, enable "Tap to translate" and then use the "To clipboard" option to show the Google Translate widget.

Each sentence can be under one of the following statuses:

- _TODO_ -- meaning that you haven't exercised with them
- _DONE_ -- meaning that you guessed all words correctly
- _REPEAT_ -- meaning that you tried, but failed, to guess words correctly. The sentence will be retried (shown in quizes) until you succeed in guessing it.
- _IGNORE_ -- meaning that you decided you don't want this sentence to show in your quizes

The app will allow only a certain number of _REPEAT_ sentences. If you reach that number, no new sentences will be shown to you. Only when you fix _REPEAT_ sentences (i.e. succeed in guessing all the words), new ones will be available for you.

# Help, FAQ

## Can I learn a language by using this app?

This app is a helper tool to help you increase your vocabulary by exposing you to thousands of sentences. In addition to using it, you should also pursue other (more traditional) ways of learning a language: speaking to native speakers, learning grammar, etc.

## Workflow

There are many ways to use this application. If you are a serious learner, you will probably develop your own daily routine.

This application is best used in combination with a translator app (or a traditional dictionary) and a memory flashcard application (like AnkiDroid).

A simple workflow:

 * Train sentence by sentence
 * If unsure about a word meaning, use a translator app to translate it (see next section for more details)
 * If not sure that the previous step really made you memorize that word, use the "Share" option to share the specific word in AnkiDroid (for example)

## Translate

Any word can be shared to any other application. For example, you can use the "Share" button to select the word and then select the app to open that word with (for example Google Translate).

If you use Google translate, you can enable the "Tap to translate" option in it. In 10,000 sentences settings enable the "Guess to clipboard". After each word guess you will see a Google Translate widget to get the translation of that word. (If the widget don't appear -- restart Google Translate).

You can also share words from Google translate directly into AnkiDroid. Just select "share" and then find "AnkiDroid" in the list.

## Text to speech

Most Android phones have text-to-speech (TTS) available for some languages. Some languages have very poor TTS voice quality. Check your phone settings to see if there is an option to download a better quality TTS. Some languages have also additional TTS applications available on the Google Play store.

# TODO

* Skip sentences for advanced users who feel the first sentences are too easy.
* Stats with graphs, goals, ...
* Add more languages
* Other quiz types (for example where the user must retype the words of a sentence, not only guess them)
